# My Next-Gen Dream PC Build Guide

This is the detailed build guide for [my next-gen dream PC build](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/user/CXwudi/saved/#view=MqFGGX)
## Caution

1. install every independent thing that can be installed on the motherboard
   1. CPU
   2. RAM (from most outside, plug into the 1 and 3 slots)
   3. M.2 SSD
2. CPU Cooler has a plastic label on the CPU touch side, remove it!
3. For AIO CPU Cooler, the highest point must not be the pump
   - the highest point is where the air gets trapped, air on the pump will make harsh sounds and break CPU Cooler
4. if going top-mount AIO CPU cooler, make sure the air is going outside from the case through the radiator, not going inside from the outside through the radiator
5. Make sure to watch out the fan blow direction
   - it usually goes from clean side to the side that has bones that holding the fan engine
   - some fans may have arrows pointing the direction
6. Lay down the case when building, don't be Linus
7. IF YOU LOSE A SCREW OR OTHER SMALL METAL OBJECT, DO NOT TURN ON YOU COMPUTER UNTIL YOU FIND IT

## Phase - before buide

### before the day of building

1. Read all manuals
2. Get ready for a safe clutter free anti-static workstation
3. Get these tools
![tools](./Screenshot%202021-08-11%20001202.png)
   - scruw driver
   - a part tray
   - knife
   - side cutter
   - needle nose pliers
   - thermal compound (or liquid metal)
   - cable ties
4. Setup and test the streaming environment
   - use Android Tablet
   - avoid using phone as it draw battery too fast
5. Design the cable management
   - from PSU to all slots on MoBo, going through which way
   - you might need a paper and pen to do the design (or surface book 2)

### on the day of building

1. Clean the table, get all tools standby
2. surface book 2 standby, with all tutorial videos opened
3. Open Streaming  
4. Recording yourself the introduction used for the vlog

## Phase - during build

### on MoBO only

1. Make myself static-safe
   1. take out the power supply
   2. turn off the power supply
   3. connect it
   4. connect myself with a anti-static strap to the power supply
2. Take out the MoBo and put it on top of the MB box
   - reason: box provide anti-static work surface
3. Install CPU
   - lift up the MoBo lever
   - carefully take out the CPU from the box, and place it on MoBo
   - watch out the arrow, arrow line up
   - no big forces, don't scruw up the CPU's pins, lift down the lever
4. Install RAMs
   - watch out the orientation, by looking at slots
   - RAMs on first and third slots starting from outside
   - RAM is installed when you hear "click" on both sides of the RAM
5. Install SSDs
   - remove heat spreader, if has one
   - check my SSD length, install the female screw.
   - put the SSD
   - install the child screw on the mother screw 
   - install back the heat spreader

### with PC case

1. Take out the PC case
2. But put both side panels back to the box
3. Do cable pre-management
   - in the case, which cable go to where, so that when the MoBo is installed, all cables are standby
   - this should be well designed during the before build phase
4. Lay down the PC case
5. Validate and install the IO shield
   - validate means IO shield fit the Mobo, fit the case, and shield doesn't block any port
6. Carefully put on the MoBo, and install it
   - 10% - 15% angle goes in
   - must be really be careful of not letting the PC case scretches the MoBo
7. Lay up the PC case
8.
