# My Next-Gen Dream PC Build Guide

## Caution

1. install every independent thing that can be installed on the motherboard
   1. CPU
   2. RAM (from most outside, plug into the 1 and 3 slots)
   3. M.2 SSD
2. CPU Cooler has a plastic label on the CPU touch side, remove it!
3. For AIO CPU Cooler, the highest point must not be the pump
   - the highest point is where the air gets trapped, air on the pump will make harsh sounds and break CPU Cooler
4. if going top-mount AIO CPU cooler, make sure the air is going outside from the case through the radiator, not going inside from the outside through the radiator
5. Make sure to watch out the fan blow direction
   - it usually goes from clean side to the side that has bones that holding the fan engine
   - some fans may have arrows pointing the direction
6. Lay down the case when building, don't be Linus
7. IF YOU LOSE A SCREW OR OTHER SMALL METAL OBJECT, DO NOT TURN ON YOU COMPUTER UNTIL YOU FIND IT
